 <h2 style="color:blue"> <center> Tom Love Innovation Hub at OU: Building and Programming </center> </h2> 
 <p> <b> We've met many people at the weekly hack and learn/ free code camp sessions once a week at the Tom Love Innovation Hub at OU ever since we've been going there since late May and many people have been able to give us programming advice. Not only does the Hub have programming advice, but they also have build/engineering advice and equipment for us to use. The students at OU sometimes have some interesting engineering designs they toss out to us as they see us working and the Hub has a lot of useful equipment such as 3D Printers. Without the Hub, we wouldn't have any 3D printed parts on our robot.  </p> 
 <h2 style="color:blue"> <center> Warren Dempsey: Build Mentor </center> </h2> 
 <p> Warren is a retired mechanical engineer, USAF and FAA. He now works on race cars and races them. He's helped us with many robot pieces such as making custom hubs for our wheels, and a sheet metal plate for the intake. He also has helped improve and given many suggestions on the bracing and overall sturdiness of the robot. </p>
